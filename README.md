# Raddish

Raddish is a custom Python library designed to extend the functionality of the `pyautogui` library.
## Features

- Text Reader 
- Smarter image searches with event hooks
- SearchRectangle objects that outline the pixel values to the screen
## Dependencies


- `pytesseract`: For OCR capabilities.
- `Pillow`: For image processing.
- `pyautogui`: For GUI automation tasks.
- `tk`: For additional displaying of the SR.

## TODO

- Fleshed out text reader
- Common standard on how we want locate functions to return (preferably in a way other pyautogui functions can ingest)
- Smarter capabilities with image search
- Clean up both functional and sandbox code
- Establish a work-flow with unittests
- Establish package to pip
